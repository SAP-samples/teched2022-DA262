# Overview on exercises and Object Model

The exercises start from an empty Guided Experience system and are building the complete end-to-end scenario from the bottom up. The graphic below gives the complete overview on the object model.

## High-level Overview on the exercises

* In [Exercise 0](../ex0), users lay hands on an empty DWC Guided Experience system. This means that they apply for their own space in a centrally-provided SAP Data Warehouse Cloud tenant. Users receive access to a single space that is initially empty. Connections to backend systems of type HANA Cloud, S/4 HANA Cloud and Google Cloud Platform are provided, but only the HANA Cloud system is relevant in the context of the exercise. In the HANA Cloud system, a schema *DA262* is prepared in which the four tables relevant to this exercise are provided, namely the tables *rt_german_car_registration*, *rt_my_company_product*, *rt_my_company_sales* and *rt_manufacturer*. 
* In [Exercise 1](../ex1), users import these HANA Cloud tables as "remote tables" by [uploading the respective DWC metadata](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATA_WAREHOUSE_CLOUD/c8a54ee704e94e15926551293243fd1d/23599e6347fb4c9e9a71c82f62449875.html) for them. This happens by virtue of a dedicated CSN files that contains the relevant metadata. To speed up data access, we are taking snapshots of these tables in DWC, thus replicating them into the DWC database. 
* In [Exercise 2](../ex2/), users combine the external dataset for car registrations with the internal master data on manufacturers. Since the brand names used externally (like e.g. *Volkswagen VW*) and internally (*Volkswagen*), a standard database join will fail to bring the two datasets together. To this end, SAP Data Warehouse Cloud is furnishing an own operator, the [Intelligent Lookup](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATA_WAREHOUSE_CLOUD/c8a54ee704e94e15926551293243fd1d/8f29f801faea4d48816d0339777f9d16.html) (cp. e.g. also [this blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/12/02/proudly-launched-intelligent-lookup-for-sap-data-warehouse-cloud/)) that bridges this problem by cleverly building up a match table that defines which brand name values actually belong to each other.  
As a preparatory step for Intelligent Lookup, the tables *RT_GERMAN_CAR_REGISTRATION* and *RT_MANUFACTURER* need to be wrapped in views that define their key fields. The reason for this: An Intelligent Lookup can only build up the above-mentioned match table, if the participating entities have key columns defined. The resulting views are called *v_german_car_registration* and *v_manufacturer*.  
* In [Exercise 3](../ex3/), the Data Builder entities created in [Exercise 2](../ex2/) are brought together in an analytical model. To this end, the participating objects need to be wrapped into [entities of the Buseinss Layer](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATA_WAREHOUSE_CLOUD/c8a54ee704e94e15926551293243fd1d/c912cdc1537d4efbb24b08327ea68918.html). The fact sources for car registrations (*il_german_car_registration*) and internal sales (*rt_my_company_sales*) are wrapped in analytical datasets. The internal product master data (*rt_my_company_product*) are wrapped in a Business Layer dimension. Additionally, an association between the fact sources and the product dimension is created. This will later be leveraged as a "shared dimension" between the registration numbers and the sales numbers in a "multi-fact model".  
Once these Business Layer entities are defined, users can continue and create a Consumption Model ([SAP Help](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATA_WAREHOUSE_CLOUD/c8a54ee704e94e15926551293243fd1d/337fa99de4a44700ba49e2214a1f3349.html)).  
Finally, we model the key figures for internal sales, overall car registration and thus market share (as internal sales divided by overall registrations). To finally expose our developments to SAC, we require a perspective - we simply generate one while previewing the data in our model. 
* Finally in [Exercise 4](../ex4/), we leverage the just-created perspective in an SAP Anayltics Cloud story. We simply create a new story, connect it to the DWC data model (i.e. the perspective) and then create the required charts & tables.
